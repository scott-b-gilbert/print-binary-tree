Print a binary tree in ascii 

# Inspiration
This StackOverflow question: 
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/801740/c-how-to-draw-a-binary-tree-to-the-console/801794#801794

I took the code from this tar file and converted it: 
http://tfsoft.org.ua/downloads/ascii_bt_linux.tar.gz

# Includes
This includes some binary tree functions, too.  It will take an array of values and convert into a tree.
See the test functions for some examples.

# TODO
This could probably do with some refactoring.  I'd like to eventually fix the unsafe code; I haven't figured out how to do that yet.
